# Final Project "Membuat Website"
Membuat Website is a final project about a website built using HTML and CSS. This website contains the Finin application as a CEX (Centralized Exchange) application that serves cryptocurrency transactions and investments. This project was organized and reviewed by Dicoding Indonesia.

## Project Overview
* There are &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt; elements in the HTML file.
* Each element contains the content for which it is intended (applying the concept of semantic HTML in structuring a website). For example:
  * There is no duplication of the &lt;main&gt; element.
  * The &lt;main&gt; element is between &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;.
  * There is a &lt;header&gt; element before &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; element after &lt;main&gt;.
  * There is a &lt;header&gt; or &lt;footer&gt; element inside the &lt;article&gt; or &lt;aside&gt; element.
* Display a photo in the &lt;aside&gt; element with a bio and a photo relevant to the website content.
* Arrange the layout using flexbox, not float.
* Resources in HTML files use relative path, not absolute path.
