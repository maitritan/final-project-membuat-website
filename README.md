# Final Project "Membuat Website"
Membuat Website is a final project about a website built using html and css. This website contains the Finin application as a CEX (Centralized Exchange) application that serves cryptocurrency transactions and investments. This project was organized and reviewed by Dicoding Indonesia.

## Project Overview
* There are <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>, and <aside> elements in the HTML file.
* Each element contains the content for which it is intended (applying the concept of semantic HTML in structuring a website). For example:
* There is no duplication of the <main> element.
* The <main> element is between <header> and <footer>.
* There is a <header> element before <main> and <footer> element after <main>.
* There is a <header> or <footer> element inside the <article> or <aside> element.
* Display a photo in the <aside> element with a bio and a photo that is relevant to the website content.
* Arrange the layout using flexbox, not float.
* Resources in HTML files use relative path, not absolute path.
